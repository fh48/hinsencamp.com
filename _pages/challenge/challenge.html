            <h2 >Who is this challenge for?</h2>
            <p>
              This challenge is for those Javascript-, frontend-, UI-, Web- Developers and
              Engineers who want to be considered a Senior.
              If you already had a couple years in the industry, this is your chance to make a jump in your career and
              excel in your field. In case you are just starting out and you want to see
              what's ahead, this challenge is also for you.
            </br>
          </br>
              When it comes to advanced engineering topics, it's easy to feel paralyzed without a mentor. Where to start? Where
              to dig into next? Especially when you are comming out of a coding bootcamp
              it's tough to get a spin on all the stuff they haven't tought you. I am talking about thing like
              algorithms, Design Patterns or Data Structures. Let's change that! With this
              challenge we will level-up and grow senior together!
            </br>
            </p>

            <h2>How does this challenge work?</h2>
            <p>
              Each Friday I send out the new challenge to all participants. The challenges
              focus on building all kinds of complex UI components, which require a good
              understanding of advanced concepts like data structures, design patterns,
              but also in-depth knowledge of web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS),
              etc. to be implemented properly. </br>
            </br>
              No worries though, I'll always provide an introduction to the very concept
              required to solve the challenge sucessfully. You can also expect a seletion
              of further learning resources. When it comes to frameworks I am not
              religious. A challenge can require to solve a problem in react, vue, or any
              of the others, or it up to you.</br>
            </br>
              You can submit your implementation here(link) to share your result with the
              community. I will add all submissions (no matter when you submit) to the
              website. Please submit your code as a codeSandbox Not to forget, with each
              new challenge you receive an in-depth tutorial explaining an implementation
              of the previous weeks task. Most importantly, keep it fun!

            <h2 >Why am I hosting this challenge?</h2>
                <p>
                  I believe programming skills should be affordable and open to all.
                  Moreover, education material should teach real world skills and make
                  theoretical concepts as easy to apply as possible. Everything else is a
                  waste a student's valuable time. Moreover, with each submission I grow
                  myself. Teaching and mentoring are two essential elements of in my
                  professional and personal development.
                </p>
              <h2 >Which technologies are covered?</h2>
                <p>
                  Technology is always changing, that's why I follow an framework agnostic
                  approach. You will see all kinds of technologies and develop an diverse
                  set of transferable skills that will translate into you being adaptable.
